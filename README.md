# Remote-GSM
Send AT commands over the internet to your remote GSM device.

## Goals and Motivation

The goal of Remote-GSM is to be able to control an AT-command driven GSM device that is connected to an Internet-connected machine.

This project was created due to the author's problem of lugging around a 16-port GSM modem pool all over coffee shops. The modem pool was large, needs planty of table space, and because of its size and blinking read lights, draws suspicion upon other people. Thus there was a need to put the machine somewhere, and just control it remotely.
